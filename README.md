Requirements
============

Python requirements are available in requirements.txt:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You also need [PyQt](http://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/download).
On Mac OS X, this is easiest with (although it seems to conflict with
virtualenv):

```bash
brew install pyqt
```
